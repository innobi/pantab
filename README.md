# Who is this for

If you are a data analyst who needs to use tableau andpython pantab is the best way to tansfer data between th two platforms.

# Watch what it can do

Insert a 30 second gif showing pantab being used by an experienced practitioner.  The idea is to sell the power of the platform.  For me personally, I don't care about installing or even reading a quick start until I understand what the software can do for me.  Sell that here

# Quick start

Explain what the following snippet does.
```python
import pantab as pt
df = pd.DataFrame({"column": np.ones(n, dtype=np.int16)})
pantab.frame_to_hyper(df, "example.hyper", table="table")
```
