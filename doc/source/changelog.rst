Pantab 1.1.1 (2020-11-02)

Pantab 1.1.0 (2020-04-30)
=========================

Special thanks to `Adrian Vogelsgesang <https://github.com/vogelsgesang>`_ for contributing to this release.

Features
--------

- Added support for reading Hyper DATE columns as datetime64 objects in pandas (#94)


Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed issue where Python would crash instead of throwing an error when reading invalid records from a Hyper file (#77)
- Fixed ImportError when building from source with tableauhyperapi versions 0.0.10309 and greater (#88)

Pantab 1.0.1 (2020-02-03)
=========================

Features
--------

- pantab will not automatically install the tableauhyperapi as a dependency when installing via pip (#83)

Pantab 1.0.0 (2020-01-15)
=========================

Special thanks to `chillerno1 <https://github.com/chillerno1>`_ for contributing to this release.

Features
--------

- pantab now supports reading/writing pandas 1.0 dtypes, namely the ``boolean`` and ``string`` dtypes. (#20)

*pantab is officially out of beta!* Thanks for all of the feedback and support of the tool so far.

Special thanks to Adrian Vogelsgesang and Jan Finis at Tableau, who offered guidance and feedback on performance improvements in this release.

- Improved error messaging when attempting to write invalid data. (#19)
- Write-performance of Hyper extracts has been drastically improved for larger datasets. (#31)
