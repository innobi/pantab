BINARY CODE LICENSE AGREEMENT

READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.

BY INSTALLING, USING OR DISTRIBUTING ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE INDICATING YOUR ASSENT, YOU ARE ACCEPTING ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. YOU AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS ENFORCEABLE LIKE ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY YOU.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE OR DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE.
IF YOU WISH TO USE THE SOFTWARE AS AN EMPLOYEE, CONTRACTOR, OR AGENT OF A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP OR SIMILAR ENTITY, THEN YOU MUST BE AUTHORIZED TO SIGN FOR AND BIND THE ENTITY IN ORDER TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE LICENSES GRANTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON ACCEPTANCE BY SUCH AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL.

This Binary Code License Agreement ("Agreement") is between Salesforce, Inc., located at Salesforce Tower, 415 Mission Street, 3rd floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 ("Salesforce") and the licensee (individual or entity) that has downloaded or otherwise procured the licensed Software (as defined below) for use ("you"). "Software" means the binary code version, and in specific instances, source code version, of the software which accompanies this license and any related supporting technical documentation provided therewith.

1.	License.

1.1	Grant of License. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Salesforce grants you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly authorized herein), non-exclusive license to (a) use the Software for your own purposes and (b) reproduce and distribute the Software in binary code form only, provided that: (i) you distribute the Software complete and unmodified and only bundled as part of, your Programs (as so bundled, the "Program Package"), (ii) the Programs add significant value to the Software, (iii) you do not distribute additional software intended to replace any component(s) of the Software, (iv) you do not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices contained in the Software, (v) you do not decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to reverse engineer the Software (except to the extent applicable law prohibits such restrictions), (vi) you do not modify or create a derivative work of the Software (except that bundling and distributing as expressly authorized hereunder is permitted), (vii) you do not make any representations, guarantees or warranties of any type with respect to the specifications, features, capabilities or otherwise concerning the Software or on behalf of Salesforce, (viii) you only distribute the Software subject to a license agreement that protects Salesforce's interests consistent with the terms contained in this Agreement, and (ix) you agree to defend and indemnify Salesforce and its licensors from and against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any third party that arises or results from the use or distribution of any and all Programs and/or Software. "Programs" means one or more software programs which you have independently developed.

1.2	Submission to Salesforce. Prior to first distribution of the Software to any third party, you shall notify Salesforce of the name of your Programs and the applicable Program Package by email to hyperapilicensing@tableau.com. Previously such notifications were sent to licensing@tableausoftware.com. Please note that we will provide limited, and potentially untimely, monitoring for such notifications. You agree that if you elect to distribute the Program Package, Salesforce may publicly disclose you as a licensee of the Software and identify your Programs and Program Package. Furthermore, if Salesforce reasonably determines that review of your Program Package is necessary for Agreement compliance verification purposes, you will, within ten (10) days of request by Salesforce, at no charge, provide Salesforce with one (1) fully enabled copy of the Program Package for use by Salesforce solely for such purposes.

1.3	Attribution, Trademarks and Logos. You agree to include the copyright notice for the Software in the "About" or other similar copyright notice designation for the Program Package and in such related product documentation which references product copyright. You further acknowledge and agree as between you and Salesforce that Salesforce owns the Salesforce and Software-related trademarks and all related trademarks, service marks, logos and other brand designations ("Salesforce Marks"), and you agree to not seek to register (including as a domain name) or use any such Salesforce Marks without Salesforce’s advance written permissions. Any use you make of the Salesforce Marks inures to Salesforce’s benefit.

1.4	Third-Party Code. The Software may contain or be provided with components subject to the terms and conditions of third-party "open source" software licenses ("Open Source Software"). A list of the Open Source Software contained in HYPER API can be found in HYPER_API_OSS_disclosure.txt. To the extent required by the license that accompanies the Open Source Software, the terms of such license will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Software, including, without limitation, any provisions governing access to source code, modification or reverse engineering.

1.5	Special Note Regarding Salesforce Open Source Projects. Salesforce may elect to release certain software under open source licenses (the "Salesforce Open Source Licenses") which may be the same as or similar to components of the Software. Nothing in the Salesforce Open Source Licenses grants any right to use the Software and this Agreement alone shall govern any use of the Software in the form provided hereunder.

2.	Ownership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except for the limited license rights expressly provided herein, Salesforce and its suppliers have and will retain all rights, title and interest (including, without limitation, all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Software and all copies, modifications and derivative works thereof (including any changes which incorporate any of your ideas, feedback or suggestions). You acknowledge that you are obtaining only a limited license right to the Software and that irrespective of any use of the words "purchase", "sale" or like terms hereunder no ownership rights are being conveyed to you under this Agreement or otherwise. If you elect to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, ideas or other feedback to Salesforce related to the Software (collectively, "Feedback"), you agree that Salesforce will be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit the Feedback provided to it as Salesforce sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind. All rights not granted by Salesforce are reserved.

3.	Term of Agreement.

Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against such party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days)). You may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to Salesforce. Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately should any Software become, or in either party’s option is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement or any intellectual property right. Termination is not an exclusive remedy and the exercise by either party of any remedy under this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise.

8.9	Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events, which occur after the signing of this Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control of the parties, such as strikes, blockades, war, terrorism, riots, natural disasters, refusal of license or approval by the government or other governmental agencies, in so far as such an event prevents or delays the affected party from fulfilling its obligations and such party is not able to prevent or remove the force majeure at reasonable cost.
